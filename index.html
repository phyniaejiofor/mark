<p>Operating System (OS) is one of the core software programs that runs on the hardware and makes it usable for the user to interact with the hardware so that they can send commands (input) and receive results (output). It provides a consistent environment for other software to execute commands. So we can say that the OS acts at the center through which the system hardware, other software, and the user communicate. <p>An Operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.</p>
<p>Time-sharing Operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.</p> For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it. Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers.
<p>The dominant desktop operating system is Microsoft Windows with a market share of around 82.74%. macOS by Apple Inc. is in second place (13.23%), and the varieties of Linux are collectively in third place (1.57%).  In the mobile (smartphone and tablet combined) sector, use in 2017 is up to 70% of Google's Android and according to third quarter 2016 data, Android on smartphones is dominant with 87.5 percent and a growth rate 10.3 percent per year, followed by Apple's iOS with 12.1 percent and a per year decrease in market share of 5.2 percent, while other operating systems amount to just 0.3 percent.  Linux distributions are dominant in the server and supercomputing sectors. Other specialized classes of operating systems, such as embedded and real-time systems, exist for many applications.</p>An operating system is the core set of software on a device that keeps everything together. Operating systems communicate with the device’s hardware. They handle everything from your keyboard and mice to the Wi-Fi radio, storage devices, and display. In other words, an operating system handles input and output devices.</p> <p>Operating systems use device drivers written by hardware creators to communicate with their devices. Operating systems also include a lot of software like common system services, libraries, and application programming interfaces (APIs) that developers can use to write programs that run on the operating system.
The operating system sits in between the applications you run and the hardware, using the hardware drivers as the interface between the two. For example, when an application wants to print something, it hands that task off to the operating system. The operating system sends the instructions to the printer, using the printer’s drivers to send the correct signals. The application that’s printing doesn’t have to care about what printer you have or understand how it works. The OS handles the details.</article>

<h2>FUNCTIONS OF OPERATING SYSTEM</h2>
The basic functions of any operating system are as following;
<ol>
<li>Interface between the user and the hardware: An OS provides an interface between user and machine. This interface can be a graphical user interface (GUI) in which users click onscreen elements to interact with the OS or a command-line interface (CLI) in which users type commands at the command-line interface (CLI) to tell the OS to do things.</li>
<li>Coordinates computer hardware: An OS enables coordination of hardware components. Each hardware device speaks a different language, but the operating system can talk to them through the specific translational software called device drivers. Every hardware component has different drivers for Operating systems. These drivers make the communication successful between the other software and the hardware.</li>
<li>Provide environment for software to function: An OS provides an environment for software applications to function. An application software is a specific software which is used to perform specific task. In GUI operating systems such as Windows and macOS, applications run within a consistent, graphical desktop environment.</li>

<li>Provide structure for data management : An OS displays structure/directories for data management. We can view file and folder listings and manipulate on those files and folders like (move, copy, rename, delete, and many others).</li></article>

<h2>Types of Operating System</h2>
There are Many Operating Systems those have be Developed for Performing the Operations those are requested by the user. There are Many Operating Systems which have the Capability to Perform the Requests those are received from the System. The Operating system can perform a Single Operation and also Multiple Operations at a Time. So there are many types of Operating systems those are organized by using their Working Techniques.

<ol>
<li>Serial Processing: The Serial Processing Operating Systems are those which Performs all the instructions into a Sequence Manner or the Instructions those are given by the user will be executed by using the FIFO Manner means First in First Out. All the Instructions those are Entered First in the System will be Executed First and the Instructions those are Entered Later Will be Executed Later. For Running the Instructions the Program Counter is used which is used for Executing all the Instructions. 
In this the Program Counter will <br>determines which instruction is going to Execute and the which instruction will be Execute after this. Mainly the Punch Cards are used for this. In this all the Jobs are firstly Prepared and Stored on the Card and after that card will be entered in the System and after that all the Instructions will be executed one by One. But the Main Problem is that a user doesn’t interact with the System while he is working on the System, means the user can’t be able to enter the data for Execution.</li> 

<li>Batch Processing: The Batch Processing is same as the Serial Processing Technique. But in the Batch Processing Similar Types of jobs are Firstly Prepared and they are Stored on the Card. and that card will be Submit to the System for the Processing. The System then Perform all the Operations on the Instructions one by one.
The Main Problem is that the Jobs those are prepared for Execution must be the Same Type and if a job requires for any type of Input then this will not be Possible for the user. And Many Time will be wasted for Preparing the Batch. The Batch Contains the Jobs and all those jobs will be executed without the user Intervention. And Operating System will use the LOAD and RUN Operation.This will first LOAD the Job from the Card and after that he will execute the instructions. By using the RUN Command.
The Speed of the Processing the Job will be Depend on the Jobs and the Results those are produced by the System in difference of Time which is used for giving or submit the Job and the Time which is used for Displaying the Results on the Screen.</li> 


<li>Multi-Programming: As we know that in the Batch Processing System there are multiple jobs Execute by the System. The System first prepare a batch and after that he will Execute all the jobs those are Stored into the Batch. But the Main Problem is that if a process or job requires an Input and Output Operation, then it is not possible and second there will be the wastage of the Time when we are preparing the batch and the CPU will remain idle at that Time.</li>  


<li>Distributed Operating System. - Distributed Means Data is Stored and Processed on Multiple Locations. When a Data is stored on to the Multiple Computers, those are placed in Different Locations. Distributed means In the Network, Network Collections of Computers are connected with Each other.</li>  

Then if we want to Take Some Data From other Computer, Then we uses the Distributed Processing System. And we can also Insert and Remove the Data from out Location to another Location. In this Data is shared between many users. And we can also Access all the Input and Output Devices are also accessed by Multiple Users.</ol></article>
